# Kmer-based FIGfam Annotation Service

## Overview

This module contains the service code that implements the now-unused FIGfam-based protein annotation service. 
It is retained for historical reasons.

## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).
